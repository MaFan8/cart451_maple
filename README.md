Final Project:

Catch!	

    For this project, I was interested in trying to displace peopleâ€™s perception of machine recognition, however through their pet dogs. The objective was to use Edge Impuse to train a model that recognizes only dogs, deploy it into an Arduino and trigger a ping pong launcher. The installation would be ideally placed with the Arduino camera facing inside a dog park, and the ping pong launcher facing out towards the general public.
